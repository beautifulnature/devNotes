== JSF and HTML5

HTML5 is currently on everyone's lips and certainly one of the most widely used and abused buzzwords in the field of web development. 
But behind the hype are a whole host of useful features and enhancements that make web developers' lives easier (and more exciting). 
High time for JSF to jump on this fast-paced train. 

Although there have already been some approaches to the integration of HTML5 into JSF in the past, the official version is only part of the specification since JSF 2.2. 
Under the generic term "HTML5 Friendly Markup" JSF brings together two fundamentally new concepts: pass-through attributes and pass-through elements.

However, we will start this chapter with a short detour to the different processing modes for facelets files in section [Facelets Processing Modes]. 
After that, we will show you the pass-through attributes in section [HTML5 Pass-Through Attributes] and the pass-through elements in section [HTML5 Pass-Through Elements]. 
Section [MyGourmet 15: HTML5] finally describes a variant of MyGourmet with the previously presented concepts.

=== Processing Modes for Facelets Files

As a first and easiest way to support HTML5, JSF 2.2 handles Facelets files slightly differently than JSF 2.1. 
Compared to the previous version, JSF 2.2 always renders the HTML5 doctype <! DOCTYPE html> - regardless of which doctype is specified in the XHTML file. 

Since JSF 2.1 there is the possibility to process facelets files in different modes. 
In JSF 2.2, this is the html5 mode by default. 
If you do not want to use the HTML5 doctype, you can change the processing mode in the `faces-config.xml` in Listing <<.Mode xhtml for facelets files, Mode xhtml for facelets files>> mode set to the xhtml (default mode in JSF 2.1).

.Mode xhtml for facelets files
[source,xml]
----
<faces-config-extension>
  <facelets-processing>
    <file-extension>.xhtml</file-extension>
    <process-as>xhtml</process-as>
  </facelets-processing>
</faces-config-extension>
----

In addition, JSF also defines the xml modes for handling facelets files in XML mode (XML declaration, doctype and comments are removed) and jspx for moving from JSP.

=== HTML5 pass-through attributes

HTML5 defines a whole range of new attributes and attribute values ​​for existing HTML elements. JSF 2.2 provides the appropriate concept for supporting these attributes with pass-through attributes. The principle is simple: Each component can have any number of pass-through attributes in addition to the "normal" attributes. These attributes are passed unchanged to the element rendered by the component and are not further processed by the component itself.

The advantage of this approach is obvious. 
JSF can support new and changed HTML5 attributes without changing existing standard components. 
The JSF specification is therefore also not dependent on the HTML5 specification. 
An important point - especially considering that the work on HTML5 is still ongoing.

JSF defines several variants for defining pass-through attributes. 
The simplest way is to define the attribute in namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/passthrough. 
For this purpose, the attribute must be provided only with the prefix of the namespace. 
The example in Listing <<.Example with pass-through attributes, Example with pass-through attributes>> shows an `h:inputTextComponent` with the two regular attributes `id` and `value` and the `pass-through attributes` `type` and `placeholder`.

.Example with pass-through attributes
[source,xhtml]
----
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
    xmlns:pt="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/passthrough">
<h:head><title>JSF 2.2 HTML5</title></h:head>
<h:body>
  <h:form id="form">
    <h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}"
        pt:type="email" pt:placeholder="E-Mail eingeben"/>
    <h:commandButton action="#{bean.save}" value="Save"/>
  </h:form>
</h:body>
</html>
----

The pass-through attributes are HTML5 extensions for the input element that are not directly supported by `h:inputText`. 
With placeholder text can be entered that will be displayed in the browser, as long as the user has entered anything yet. 
In the attribute type, one of the new types for input fields is used with `email`. 
The rendered HTML for the `h:inputText` tag contains all four attributes as expected:

[source,html]
----
<input id="form:email" name="form:email" value=""
    placeholder="E-Mail eingeben" type="email"/>
----

Table: html5-input-ex shows some examples of how to display the input element with the additional HTML5 attributes in the browser. 
The validation of the e-mail address is carried out by the browser on the client side when submitting the form - JSF gets nothing from it. 
But beware: Not all HTML5 features are supported by all browsers alike. 
An up-to-date overview of which browser versions support HTML5 features can be found at http://caniuse.com.

//-------------
|Empty input field	a|image::images/input-email-empty.jpg[]
|Invalid e-mail (Chrome 28)	a|image::images/input-email-ch28w.jpg[]
|Invalid e-mail (Firefox 23)	a|image::images/input-email-ff23w.jpg[]
|===

In addition to the variant with the namespace, you can also define pass-through attributes with the tag `f:passThroughAttribute`. 
The name of the pass-through attribute is given in `name` and the value in `value`, as Listing shows <<.pass-through attributes over tags, pass-through attributes over tags>>. 
The rendered output does not change as a result.

.pass-through attributes over tags
[source,xhtml]
----
<h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}">
  <f:passThroughAttribute name="type" value="email"/>
  <f:passThroughAttribute name="placeholder"
      value="E-Mail eingeben"/>
</h:inputText>
----

If these two variants are not yet enough for you, you can also get pass-through attributes with the tag `f:passThroughAttributes` from a bean property with the type `Map<String, Object>`, such as Listing <<.pass-through attributes from Bean property, .pass-through attributes from Bean property>> shows.

.pass-through attributes from Bean property
[source,xhtml]
----
<h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}">
  <f:passThroughAttributes value="#{bean.attributes}"/>
</h:inputText>
----

Listing <<.Bean property for pass-through attributes, .Bean property for pass-through attributes>> shows the bean property matching the listing <<.pass-through attributes from Bean property, pass-through attributes from Bean property>>.

[source,java]
----
public Map<String, Object> getAttributes() {
  Map<String, Object> attrs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
  attrs.put("placeholder", "E-Mail eingeben");
  attrs.put("type", "email");
  return attrs;
}
----

Pass-Through Attributes also allow use of HTML5 Custom Data Attributes. 
For details on HTML5 Custom Data attributes, see http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes. 
These attributes are intended to provide HTML elements with additional data. 
You recognize them immediately by their name, which always starts with the prefix data-. 
Custom data attributes are stored in the `DOM` and are available there for processing with `JavaScript`. 

The following example shows an `h:inputText` tag with the custom data attribute `data-required` in the form of a pass-through attribute.

[source,xhtml]
----
<h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}"
    pt:type="email" pt:data-required="true"/>
----

This attribute has no special meaning and is not treated separately by JSF or the browser. 
However, it can be used in the JavaScript code of the application, for example for client-side validation.

=== HTML5 pass-through elements

=== MyGourmet 15: HTML5

MyGourmet 15 is an extended version of MyGourmet 14 that has been extended in some places with pass-through attributes and pass-through elements. 

For example, in `editAddress.xhtml`, all input fields got the HTML5 attribute placeholder via `f:passThroughAttribute`. 
In `editProvider.xhtml`, on the other hand, placeholder was added directly as an attribute in the `pass-through` namespace. 
Furthermore, the composite component `mc:inputSpinner` has been replaced by an input field with the new HTML5 type `number`, as the following example shows.

[source,xml]
----
<h:inputText pt:type="number" pt:min="0" pt:step="1"
    value="#{providerBean.provider.stars}"
    pt:placeholder="#{msgs.enter_stars}"/>
----

If the browser supports this type, it will natively display a number entry field with buttons to increase and decrease the value. 

In `editCustomer.xhtml`, as far as possible, all JSF tags have been replaced by `pass-through elements`. In addition, the input field for the e-mail address uses the HTML5 type `e-mail`.
