== JSF and HTML5

HTML5 is currently on everyone's lips and certainly one of the most widely used and abused buzzwords in the field of web development. 
But behind the hype are a whole host of useful features and enhancements that make web developers' lives easier (and more exciting). 
High time for JSF to jump on this fast-paced train. 

Although there have already been some approaches to the integration of HTML5 into JSF in the past, the official version is only part of the specification since JSF 2.2. 
Under the generic term "HTML5 Friendly Markup" JSF brings together two fundamentally new concepts: pass-through attributes and pass-through elements.

However, we will start this chapter with a short detour to the different processing modes for facelets files in section [Facelets Processing Modes]. 
After that, we will show you the pass-through attributes in section [HTML5 Pass-Through Attributes] and the pass-through elements in section [HTML5 Pass-Through Elements]. 
Section [MyGourmet 15: HTML5] finally describes a variant of MyGourmet with the previously presented concepts.

=== Processing Modes for Facelets Files

As a first and easiest way to support HTML5, JSF 2.2 handles Facelets files slightly differently than JSF 2.1. 
Compared to the previous version, JSF 2.2 always renders the HTML5 doctype <! DOCTYPE html> - regardless of which doctype is specified in the XHTML file. 

Since JSF 2.1 there is the possibility to process facelets files in different modes. 
In JSF 2.2, this is the html5 mode by default. 
If you do not want to use the HTML5 doctype, you can change the processing mode in the `faces-config.xml` in Listing <<.Mode xhtml for facelets files, Mode xhtml for facelets files>> mode set to the xhtml (default mode in JSF 2.1).

.Mode xhtml for facelets files
[source,xml]
----
<faces-config-extension>
  <facelets-processing>
    <file-extension>.xhtml</file-extension>
    <process-as>xhtml</process-as>
  </facelets-processing>
</faces-config-extension>
----

In addition, JSF also defines the xml modes for handling facelets files in XML mode (XML declaration, doctype and comments are removed) and jspx for moving from JSP.

=== HTML5 pass-through attributes

HTML5 defines a whole range of new attributes and attribute values ​​for existing HTML elements. JSF 2.2 provides the appropriate concept for supporting these attributes with pass-through attributes. The principle is simple: Each component can have any number of pass-through attributes in addition to the "normal" attributes. These attributes are passed unchanged to the element rendered by the component and are not further processed by the component itself.

The advantage of this approach is obvious. 
JSF can support new and changed HTML5 attributes without changing existing standard components. 
The JSF specification is therefore also not dependent on the HTML5 specification. 
An important point - especially considering that the work on HTML5 is still ongoing.

JSF defines several variants for defining pass-through attributes. 
The simplest way is to define the attribute in namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/passthrough. 
For this purpose, the attribute must be provided only with the prefix of the namespace. 
The example in Listing <<.Example with pass-through attributes, Example with pass-through attributes>> shows an `h:inputTextComponent` with the two regular attributes `id` and `value` and the `pass-through attributes` `type` and `placeholder`.

.Example with pass-through attributes
[source,xhtml]
----
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
    xmlns:pt="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/passthrough">
<h:head><title>JSF 2.2 HTML5</title></h:head>
<h:body>
  <h:form id="form">
    <h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}"
        pt:type="email" pt:placeholder="E-Mail eingeben"/>
    <h:commandButton action="#{bean.save}" value="Save"/>
  </h:form>
</h:body>
</html>
----

The pass-through attributes are HTML5 extensions for the input element that are not directly supported by `h:inputText`. 
With placeholder text can be entered that will be displayed in the browser, as long as the user has entered anything yet. 
In the attribute type, one of the new types for input fields is used with `email`. 
The rendered HTML for the `h:inputText` tag contains all four attributes as expected:

[source,html]
----
<input id="form:email" name="form:email" value=""
    placeholder="E-Mail eingeben" type="email"/>
----

Table: html5-input-ex shows some examples of how to display the input element with the additional HTML5 attributes in the browser. 
The validation of the e-mail address is carried out by the browser on the client side when submitting the form - JSF gets nothing from it. 
But beware: Not all HTML5 features are supported by all browsers alike. 
An up-to-date overview of which browser versions support HTML5 features can be found at http://caniuse.com.

|Invalid e-mail (Firefox 23)	a|image::images/input-email-ff23w.jpg[]
|===

In addition to the variant with the namespace, you can also define pass-through attributes with the tag `f:passThroughAttribute`. 
The name of the pass-through attribute is given in `name` and the value in `value`, as Listing shows <<.pass-through attributes over tags, pass-through attributes over tags>>. 
The rendered output does not change as a result.

.pass-through attributes over tags
[source,xhtml]
----
<h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}">
  <f:passThroughAttribute name="type" value="email"/>
  <f:passThroughAttribute name="placeholder"
      value="E-Mail eingeben"/>
</h:inputText>
----

If these two variants are not yet enough for you, you can also get pass-through attributes with the tag `f:passThroughAttributes` from a bean property with the type `Map<String, Object>`, such as Listing <<.pass-through attributes from Bean property, .pass-through attributes from Bean property>> shows.

.pass-through attributes from Bean property
[source,xhtml]
----
<h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}">
  <f:passThroughAttributes value="#{bean.attributes}"/>
</h:inputText>
----

Listing <<.Bean property for pass-through attributes, .Bean property for pass-through attributes>> shows the bean property matching the listing <<.pass-through attributes from Bean property, pass-through attributes from Bean property>>.

[source,java]
----
public Map<String, Object> getAttributes() {
  Map<String, Object> attrs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
  attrs.put("placeholder", "E-Mail eingeben");
  attrs.put("type", "email");
  return attrs;
}
----

Pass-Through Attributes also allow use of HTML5 Custom Data Attributes. 
For details on HTML5 Custom Data attributes, see http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes. 
These attributes are intended to provide HTML elements with additional data. 
You recognize them immediately by their name, which always starts with the prefix data-. 
Custom data attributes are stored in the `DOM` and are available there for processing with `JavaScript`. 

The following example shows an `h:inputText` tag with the custom data attribute `data-required` in the form of a pass-through attribute.

[source,xhtml]
----
<h:inputText id="email" value="#{bean.email}"
    pt:type="email" pt:data-required="true"/>
----

This attribute has no special meaning and is not treated separately by JSF or the browser. 
However, it can be used in the JavaScript code of the application, for example for client-side validation.

=== HTML5 pass-through elements

Traditionally, JSF developers mostly build JSF tags on the pages of an application and only indirectly interact with the rendered HTML elements. 
With the increased use of client-side technologies such as JavaScript, however, it is increasingly important to know the structure of the page in detail. 
JSF 2.2 offers a solution to this problem with `pass-through` elements. 

`Pass-through` elements are HTML elements that connect to matching JSF components in the component tree. 
By definition, an HTML element becomes a pass-through element if and only if at least one of its attributes is defined in the namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf . 

Listing <<.example with pass-through elements, example with pass-through elements>> shows again the example from listing example with pass-through attributes. 
However, this version has replaced all JSF tags with pass-through elements. 
This does not change the functionality and even the component tree on the server has not changed significantly.

.example with pass-through elements
[source,html]
----
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:jsf="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf">
<head jsf:id="head"><title>JSF 2.2 HTML5</title></head>
<body jsf:id="body">
  <form jsf:id="form">
    <input type="text" placeholder="E-Mail eingeben"
        jsf:id="email" jsf:value="#{bean.email}"/>
    <button jsf:action="#{bean.save}">Save</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
----

How does this work? If at least one attribute of an HTML element is defined in the namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf, JSF transforms that HTML element into a JSF tag and inserts the appropriate component into the component tree. 
The decision of which JSF tag is used is made by JSF based on the element name. 
If this does not result in a clear assignment, in some cases the value of an attribute is also included in the decision. 

Let's take a closer look at this using the example from the listing example with pass-through elements. 
Because the element head with id is an attribute in the namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf has, it is treated as a pass-through element. 
JSF therefore transforms the head element into the JSF tag `h:head` and sets its `id` attribute to the specified `value`. Analogously, the element body is transformed into `h:body` and form in `h:form`.

The input element can only be uniquely transformed taking the attribute type into consideration. 
From the combination of `input` and type = "text", JSF makes the tag `h:inputText`. 
Let's take another look at the attributes of input, both `id` and `value` have a prefix and are thus passed directly to the component. 
However, after the HTML5 attribute has placeholder but no prefix, it is added as a `pass-through attribute` to `h:inputText`, not as a normal attribute. 
Otherwise it would not be possible, since `h:inputText` does not define an attribute with the name placeholder. 
This example makes it easy to see how `pass-through element` and `pass-through attributes` complement each other. 

Table: html5-pte-mapping shows a complete list of assignments of element-attribute combinations to JSF tags defined in JSF 2.2. 
Attributes with the prefix jsf in the second column indicate attributes in the namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf. 
In turn, a star means that the value of the attribute is not relevant to the mapping.

|===

After `pass-through` elements are transformed into JSF tags, they can also be treated like JSF tags. 
For example, in the following code snippet, a validator is added directly to the HTML element using `f:validateLength`. 
Admittedly, this looks somewhat strange at first glance, but it works perfectly.

[source,html]
----
<input type="text" jsf:value="#{bean.name}">
  <f:validateLength minimum="3"/>
</input>
----

In the next example, the element `a` is transformed into an `h:link` tag with the attribute `jsf:outcome`. 
Therefore, it is also possible to define the `id` with `f:param` as the parameter for the rendered link.

[source,html]
----
<a jsf:outcome="details" title="Show #{person.name}">
  #{person.name}
  <f:param name="id" value="#{person.id}"/>
</a>
----

Be very careful about which attributes of `pass-through elements` you define in the namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf. 
In the next example, the value attribute is defined without a namespace and will pass to the component as a `pass-through attribute` - a big difference, as we'll see shortly.

[source,html]
----
<input jsf:id="name" type="text" value="#{bean.name}">
  <f:validateLength minimum="3"/>
</input>
----

At first glance, the example works without problems. 
However, the rendered value is not managed by the component, but always written directly from the value expression to the rendered output. 
In the case of a validation error, however, the user gets to see the old value again and not the submitted value.

TIP: For pass-through elements, be sure to define all the attributes that belong to the component in the namespace http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf.

JSF can also handle `pass-through elements` that do not have a fixed assignment to a JSF tag. 
In this case, a generic component is inserted in the component tree. 
This also makes it possible to make HTML5 elements such as `progress pass-through elements` and even equip them with Ajax behavior, as the following example shows. 
Each click on the `progress element` triggers an Ajax request and renders the component associated with it.

[source,html]
----
<button jsf:action="#{bean.update}">
  Aktualisieren
  <f:ajax render="progress"/>
</button>
<progress jsf:id="progress" max="10" value="#{bean.progress}">
  <f:ajax event="click" render="@this"/>
</progress>
----

=== MyGourmet 15: HTML5

MyGourmet 15 is an extended version of MyGourmet 14 that has been extended in some places with pass-through attributes and pass-through elements. 

For example, in `editAddress.xhtml`, all input fields got the HTML5 attribute placeholder via `f:passThroughAttribute`. 
In `editProvider.xhtml`, on the other hand, placeholder was added directly as an attribute in the `pass-through` namespace. 
Furthermore, the composite component `mc:inputSpinner` has been replaced by an input field with the new HTML5 type `number`, as the following example shows.

[source,xml]
----
<h:inputText pt:type="number" pt:min="0" pt:step="1"
    value="#{providerBean.provider.stars}"
    pt:placeholder="#{msgs.enter_stars}"/>
----

If the browser supports this type, it will natively display a number entry field with buttons to increase and decrease the value. 

In `editCustomer.xhtml`, as far as possible, all JSF tags have been replaced by `pass-through elements`. In addition, the input field for the e-mail address uses the HTML5 type `e-mail`.
