== Eclipse

`Eclipse` is currently one of the most popular development environments for Java applications, which is also available under an open source license. 
This triumphant success occurred Eclipse in 2001, when IBM published the sources. 
Since 2004, the Eclipse Foundation has been responsible for the further development of Eclipse.
It has grown into one of the largest Java open source communities besides the Apache Software Foundation.

Since then Eclipse has become moving away from a pure development environment for Java to a platform for various programming languages ​​and rich client applications of all kinds - and with ever-growing success. 
A variety of plug-ins have been developed, which can be used to extend the basic functionality by many aspects. 

With version 3.2, published in 2006, the publication of the most important Eclipse projects was coordinated. 
Since then, a new release of Eclipse appears once a year - currently known as the Juno 4.2 version is currently. 

Eclipse itself already provides good support for the development of JSF applications with the Web Tools Platform (WTP) project.

=== Installing Eclipse with Maven support

Since the consolidation of the individual projects in 2006, Eclipse is available in several versions for different purposes for download on http://www.eclipse.org. 
For our purposes, the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers package is best. 
In addition to the tools for developing Java applications, it also includes the previously mentioned Web Tools Platform (WTP). 

The instructions described here apply to Eclipse in the version Juno (4.2) SR2. 
The installation of Eclipse is very simple, the only requirement is a running Java Runtime in a version from 6.0. 
After downloading the software package mentioned above, it must be unpacked into any directory. 
You can then start the application. 

Eclipse now has a great plug-in for integrating Maven with the name Maven Integration for Eclipse. 
Unfortunately, this plug-in is not included in the chosen Eclipse IDE package by default. 

However, the current version of the Maven integration can be easily obtained from the Eclipse Marketplace. 
Go to Help | Eclipse Marketplace ... and simply enter the name of the plug-in in the search box. 
After pressing the Enter key, a selection of available extensions should be displayed. 
Figure <<.Eclipse Marketplace with Plug-in Maven Integration, Eclipse Marketplace with Plug-in Maven Integration>> displays the Eclipse Marketplace window with the appropriate choices.

Now it's especially important that you install the Maven Integration for Eclipse WTP package rather than Maven Integration for Eclipse by clicking the Install button. 
This is the only way to ensure optimal integration between Maven and the Web Tools Platform (WTP). 
After rebooting Eclipse, Maven integration is available with the ability to directly import Maven projects.

=== Setting up Apache Tomcat 7 in Eclipse

If you have not previously configured a server, Eclipse will open a wizard to set up a new server the first time the web application is started. 
For the book examples Apache Tomcat 7.0 is particularly good. 
Figure <<.Create Debug Configuration in Eclipse WTP, Create Debug Configuration in Eclipse WTP>> shows the three steps to create a debug configuration with Tomcat 7.0.

In the first step, select Apache | Tomcat v7.0 Server as the server type and click Next. 
The second step is to specify the path of a local installation of Tomcat 7.0. 
If you have not already installed Tomcat 7.0, you can find the latest version at http://tomcat.apache.org. 
After specifying the path, click Next again. 
In the last step, you can still specify which projects are deployed to the server. 
A final click on the Finish button finishes setting up and booting up the server.
