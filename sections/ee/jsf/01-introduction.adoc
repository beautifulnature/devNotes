== Introduction to JavaServer Faces

*Variety of technologies:*

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a modern web application development technology. However, is not alone in the field - there are dozens of open source-published and hundreds of proprietary frameworks for developing web applications in the Java domain alone, leaving other programming languages ​​aside. The elephant among these java frameworks is certainly Apache Struts, but Apache Wicket and Apache Tapestry are also very successful. The first question is why such a variety of frameworks have evolved and why the need for specifying the JavaServer FacesTechnology emerged - after all, there is already a solid basis for the dynamic creation of web pages with the servlet and JSP technology. The description of the historical development of web programming will contribute to the understanding here.

=== Short History of Web Development

*HTML and HTTP:*

It all started with the first page in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) in August 1991. Few visionaries at the time knew what development the World Wide Web would take over the years. Exponential growth had been cradled in the World Wide Web, both in terms of diffusion and technological development. At first, HTML was a simple language for tagging text parts. Due to the multiple application in different areas HTML has been extended more and more to the layout language. The resulting sprawl of markup elements for a variety of purposes was opposed to the layout language CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

*Server:*

At the same time, there was a similar revolution of languages ​​and scripting languages ​​on the server - countless server-side technologies fought for the favor of web developers, Perl, Phyton, PHP, Ruby and of course Java are just a few examples. No wonder that with so many technologies involved, the development of large, high-dynamic web applications has become more and more complex - helping designers overcome this complexity.

==== History of Web Development with Java

*Servlets:*

In the Java domain, the development of servlet technology in 1997 was the first step in the dynamic generation of HTML pages on the server. Essentially, this technology relies on the inclusion of commands in the Java code that are used to generate HTML. In practice, this means calling the println function on an OutputStream as in the Listing example of a SampleServlet. Here the GET method of the HTTP request is treated.

.SimpleServlet.java
[source,java]
----
public class SampleServlet extends HttpServlet {
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req,
                    HttpServletResponse res)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
    String name = req.getParameter("name");
    String text = req.getParameter("text");

    res.setContentType("text/html");

    ServletOutputStream out = res.getOutputStream();
    out.println("<html><head><title>");
    out.println(name);
    out.println("</title></head><body>");
    out.println(text);
    out.println("</body></html>");
    out.flush();
  }
}
----

It is easy to imagine that this generation of HTML from normal Java code becomes difficult to understand and confusing over long HTML passages. In a second step, auxiliary classes were created, which made it easier to write HTML tags by calling certain methods. The creation of HTML was thus limited to calling these methods, as Listing shows a simple (but incomplete) helper class for writing HTML code in servlets.

.SevletUtility.java
[source,java]
----
public class ServletUtility {
  private HttpServletResponse res;
  public ServletUtility(HttpServletResponse res) {
    this.res = res;
  }
  public void startTag(String tagName) {
    res.print("<");
    res.print(tagName);
  }
  public void endTag(String tagName) {
    res.print("</");
    res.print(tagName);
    res.print(">");
  }
  ...
}
----

*JSP:*

This approach was not optimal for complex HTML pages, which led to the development of JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology. An example in this language can be found in Listing A Simple JSP Example. Here HTML is the driving force and in the individual tags of the HTML are called in Scriptlets the calls of the Java methods for the expenditure of the dynamic parts of the HTML side. This approach greatly facilitated the creation of complex HTML pages with much built-in JavaScript code and a high number of CSS awards.

.Simple.jsp
[source,jsp]
----
<@ page language="java" >
<html>
  <head>
    <title><=request.getParameter("name");></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <=request.getParameter("text");>
  </body>
</html>
----

However, anything that can be "used" can also be "misused", and this is precisely the case for JSP technology. The developers began to include more and more code in each JSP page, until again a highly complex mix of HTML tags and Java code was created. This mix was as bad to maintain as the built-in servlet code HTML generation. Another criticism of the use of JSP was that the built-in source code was only compiled in the application server at the time of application startup, and many of the bugs that were normally removed when creating Java classes from the source code were not run until runtime occurred. Of course, the importance of this problem increases with the amount of source code included in the JSP page.

*Web frameworks:*

To solve this problem, web frameworks came on the scene. When using a framework, the developer is encouraged to create as much of the layout description as possible in a page description language such as JSP and at the same time to insert as little functionality as possible between the elements of the page declaration language in the sense of application logic.

*Model View Controller (MVC):*

A clear cut between model, view, and control logic is needed - this development pattern is also called Model View Controller Pattern (MVC for short) and is shown in Figure The Model View Controller Principle shown.

====
.The Model View Controller Principle
image::images/jsf/mvc.jpg[]
====

*Model2 - MVC for the Web:*

Web development with Java has established a special form of this design pattern called Model2. The term Model2 comes from the specification of the JSP standard and describes the transfer of the MVC approach into the world of web development with Java. This shape is very similar to the underlying MVC pattern, except that the different occurrences of Model, View, and Controller are defined in more detail here, Figure shows The Model2 principle as a specialization of the Model-View-Controller architecture. For almost all Java framework web frameworks, the Model2 pattern serves as the foundation of the architecture. As a control logic (controller) while a servlet is used and most of the model in the form of Java classes, often as beans or POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), executed. There are many ways of declaring the view - Velocity is used for Turbine, Cocoon for an XML dialect, and Struts and JSF for Version 2.0 JavaServer Pages (JSPs). As of version 2.0, JSF defaults to facelets (XHTML) as the page declaration language.

*Components:*

In the beginning, this separation of the individual layers of an application was the highest priority on the task list of the individual web frameworks. All of the above frameworks have solved this problem in the field of web development in their own way. Over time, however, this split was no longer the only need in web development and other aspects such as reusability of components came to the fore. The time was more than ripe for JavaServer Faces (JSF) as the basis for a component-oriented development.

==== Origin of JavaServer Faces

*JSF as standard:*

JavaServer Faces (JSF) was developed not least as a technology to standardize the diverse approaches to the development of web applications under Java. This standardization is carried out as part of the Java Community Process (JCP). 
The Java Community Process defines the framework for developing specifications for extending the Java platform. Proposals for specifications are submitted there in the form of Java Specification Requests (JSRs) with a sequential number and edited by an expert group. Each JSR goes through a multi-stage process until a final version is available. 
The specification of version 1.0 of JavaServer Faces (JSR-127) was released in 2004 and replaced by bug-fix version 1.1 just months later. In 2006, version 1.2 followed the JSF specification (JSR-252) as part of Java EE 5. Version 1.1 and Version 1.2 laid the foundation for the rise of JavaServer Faces to the most important technologies in Java web development - especially JSF 1.2 was very strong over several years. 
With the introduction of version 2.0 (JSR-314) in 2009 as part of Java EE 6 a new chapter in JSF development was opened. In the three years between the release of version 1.2 and version 2.0, many new trends and technologies have seen the light of day. In addition, JSF's growing popularity had created a very active community. Numerous projects have developed new component libraries, libraries for integrating new technologies or solutions to imperfections and unaddressed areas in the specification. 
The Expert Group was involved in the design of JavaServer Faces 2.0 some of the new features based on solutions from then popular libraries. Standardization improved the compatibility of component libraries and extensions from multiple vendors, which in turn simplified the lives of developers. 
JSF 2.1 brought only minor changes to existing features in November 2010. Only JSF 2.2 (JSR-344) brought in May 2013, in addition to a variety of detail improvements again a whole lot of new features with it. 
So much for the historical development of JavaServer Faces. If you have already gained experience with older JSF versions, you can search for information in the following sections. Section [Section: JSF 2.0 and 2.1 at a glance] shows improvements of JSF 2.0 and 2.1 and section [Section: JSF 2.2 at a glance] What's new in JSF 2.2. In section [Section: The First JSF Example], the first example really starts.

=== JSF 2.0 and 2.1 at a glance

=== JSF 2.2 at a glance

=== The ecosystem of JavaServer Faces

=== The first JSF example

Nothing gives a better insight into a technology as a short example. Therefore, we will start directly with a Hello World example in JavaServer Faces. In a first step, Section [Software Environment ] describes the software environment relevant to the book examples. After all the examples are very similar, we then take a look at the basic project structure in section [Section: Project structure with Maven]. In the section [  Hello World : the first JSF project], the example Hello World really gets down to business. The complete source code of all book examples can be found at http://jsfatwork.irian.at.

==== Software environment

As a basis for all examples and tools used, a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6 or 7 must be installed on the computer.

For an easy start with JSF, all our examples are based on the popular build tool Apache Maven. Maven is an extremely helpful tool for managing Java-based projects. In addition to a standardized description of projects in the Project Object Model ( pom.xml ) and a standardized build process, Maven also provides automatic resolution of dependencies on other projects and libraries.

A detailed introduction to the basic concepts of Maven would go beyond the scope of this chapter - but do not worry, we will not let you down in the rain. In Appendix Chapter: A brief introduction to Maven you will find all sorts of things to know about Maven including installation instructions. There we will also show you how you can automate the project creation process with Maven.

With Maven, the web application can also be started from the command line - except for a simple editor, no development environment is theoretically necessary. It is always easier with a development environment such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans, especially since all three now directly with Maven projects can handle. We focus on Eclipse in this book - not because it's the best, but because it's the most widely-disclosed development environment for Java. Eclipse even offers useful support for developing JSF applications with the Web Tools Platform (WTP) extension. Details on JSF development with Eclipse can be found in the section [Development with Eclipse] and in Appendix Chapter: Eclipse.

JSF applications are classic servlet Java web applications. The book examples require a servlet container runtime environment that supports at least Servlet 3.0, such as Apache Tomcat 7 or Jetty 8. In section [Section: Starting the application with Maven] we show you how to start the example with Maven directly from the command line with Jetty 8. See section [Development with Eclipse] for instructions on how to start the examples using Apache Tomcat 7 from Eclipse.

==== Project structure with Maven

For Maven, the motto is: "Do you know a project, do you all know". The reason for this is that Maven by convention defines a structure that should be respected by all projects. The structure of this project structure thus always follows the same pattern. 
In addition to the description of the project in the pom.xml file, the src directory with the main subdirectory is also created in the project directory. There we put the source code of our project in three further subdirectories. All Java classes get into the subdirectory java, all resources like.properties files get into the subdirectory resources and all files relevant for the web application in the subdirectory webapp. In the Hello World project structure, you can see the complete project structure of the Hello World example.

====
.Structure of the Hello World project
image::images/jsf/helloworld-struct.jpg[]

==== Hello World: the first JSF project

When you start a new JSF project, you should start by opting for one of the two implementations. We do not want to make a clear recommendation here because this decision depends on many factors. Just that much: you can build great JSF applications with both MyFaces and Mojarra. 

Thanks to Maven, integrating the JSF implementation is child's play. It just needs to be added as a dependency to the description of the project in the pom.xml file. The complete file can be found in the source code of the application, for us at the moment only the part with the JSF implementation is interesting. Listing dependencies to Apache MyFaces in the pom.xml shows the dependencies for Apache MyFaces in version 2.2.1. The library with Artifact-ID myfaces-api contains the standardized API of JSF 2.2 and the library with the Artifact-ID myfaces-impl the implementation.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.myfaces.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>myfaces-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.1</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.myfaces.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>myfaces-impl</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.1</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Listing dependencies to Mojarra in the pom.xml shows as an alternative the dependencies for Mojarra in version 2.2.2. The library with the Artifact-ID jsf-api contains the standardized API of JSF 2.2 and the library with the Artifact-ID jsf-impl the concrete implementation of Mojarra.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.2</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsf-impl</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.2</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

By default, all examples use Mojarra. If you want to modify the JSF implementations for testing, you do not need to edit the pom.xml file. All MyGourmet examples define profiles for Mojarra (is active by default) and for MyFaces. How to use these profiles is shown in Appendix Chapter: A Brief Introduction to Maven.
Declaration of the view: Now we come to the most important part of our application: As for a Hello WorldApplication, we want to print the text "Hello JSF 2.2-World" on the start page of our application. To do this, we create the JSF page declaration hello.xhtml in the webapp directory (see listing The page declaration hello.xhtml).

.hello.xhtml
[source,xhtml]
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html">
<head>
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h:outputText value="Hello JSF 2.2-World"/>
</body>
</html>
----

The skeleton of this page is a standard XHTML document with an h:outputText embedded in the body element to output the message. This tag provided by JSF outputs the text specified in the value attribute. The h: prefix is associated with the redefined http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html namespace in JSF 2.2 and identifies the JSF HTML tag library. In addition to the tag h:outputText, it also contains a number of additional tags for standard JSF components and their representation as HTML output - but more on that later in Chapter Chapter: Standard JSF Components.

web.xml: In the second step, we will create the web configuration file web.xml in the / WEB-INF directory of our web application. The web.xml file is also called Deployment Descriptor of the web application: so that the JSF technology can be accessed. This is done by integrating the JSF servlet in the form of a servlet definition and a servlet mapping, as Listing shows the configuration file web.xml with the specification of a FacesServlet and the associated servlet mapping. The specified servlet-mapping element will result in all queries ending in .xhtml edited by exactly this JSF servlet. 
The context parameter javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE sets the project stage to Development. This tells JSF that we are currently in the development phase of the project. The effects of this can be found in section Section: Project-Stage.

.web.xml
[source,xml]
----
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
     http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
   version="3.0">
  <description>JSF 2.0 - Hello World</description>
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>Faces Servlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
      javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet
    </servlet-class>

  <context-param>
    <param-name>javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE</param-name>
    <param-value>Development</param-value>
  </context-param>
</web-app>
----

Last but not least we define the page hello.xhtml as welcome file of the application. This ensures that the page is always displayed when a user in the browser enters the URL of the application without specifying a specific page. 

Congratulations - you have just written your first web application with JavaServer Faces! In the next section we will show you how to start the application directly with Maven. This example was of course only the beginning, so if you have any questions, we invite you to read on.

==== Starting the application with Maven

To start the Hello World application, the Jetty-Maven plug-in is used. Jetty is a servlet container that serves as the runtime environment for our JSF application and can be launched from the console. Fast prototyping for the first versions of the web application can be a perfect fit here. The command to start the server is:

----
mvn clean jetty:run
----

This must be entered again in the project directory. The required files are automatically reloaded into the local repository by Maven. Then the server starts and the application can be called up in the address bar of the browser as follows:

----
http://localhost:8080/helloworld/
----

The build process of the project can then be restarted with this command:

----
mvn install
----

Maven creates the subfolder target with the compiled classes and the .war archive. The .war file contains all the libraries needed to run the web application that Maven has added through the dependencies in the pom.xml project file. The project was installed in the local repository under the group id at.irian.jsfatwork and the artifact id helloworld. Figure application in the local repository shows the directory structure in the local repository.

==== Development with Eclipse

With Maven, we already have a solid foundation for the simple and efficient management of JSF projects. So far we have only used Maven from the command line. However, day-to-day development is much easier with a development environment such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Fortunately, this is no longer a problem, as all of the above development environments support direct handling of Maven projects. 

In this section we focus on JSF development with Eclipse, as it is freely available and very widely used. A detailed guide To set up Eclipse to work with JSF and the book examples, see Appendix Chapter: Eclipse.

:sectnums:
===== Working with Eclipse

After launching Eclipse, you should be in the "Java EE" perspective as shown in Figure. Eclipse with the Hello World project open. If this is not the case, you can switch to this perspective via Window | Open Perspective | Other ....

====
.Eclipse with Hello World project open
image::images/jsf/eclipse-wtp-gui.jpg[]
====

As shown in Figure Eclipse with the Hello World project open, Eclipse now provides an editor and a WYSIWYG view for each JSF page. This editor makes it easy to create JSF pages yourself and to include components on these pages. The editor is started by double-clicking on a JSF file. This opens the JSF editor with a source code view and a WYSIWYG view. From the toolbar on the right, components can be dragged directly to the top or bottom, and the resulting components are automatically displayed by the WYSIWYG view.

Another helpful feature is the properties-Tab. There you will find a list of all attributes of the component selected in the editor with the option to edit the values. If the Properties tab is not displayed, you can show it via Window | Show View | Properties . 

As an example we will insert a new component in our XHTML file called hello.xhtml. Double-clicking on the file opens the editor. If Eclipse opens the file in a "normal" editor, you have to change the editor type in the context menu via Open With | Web Page Editor change. Then, in the component palette, select the Output Text item in the JSF HTML tab and drag it to the source code view or WYSIWYG view. Clicking on the component in the editor displays the attributes in the Properties tab. Once there, the attribute value, for example, the value "Hello again!" on. You can also change the appearance of the component by, for example, entering the value "color: Red" for the attribute style. The display in the WYSIWYG view will be adapted immediately. Figure Eclipse WTP Property Editor shows the editor with the added component and its attributes in the Properties tab.

====
.Eclipse WTP Property Editor
image::images/jsf/eclipse-wtp-props.jpg[]

==== Starting the application with Eclipse

From Eclipse, you can launch and debug JSF applications directly on a variety of different servers. You must first select the project to be started in the Project Explorer and on the shortcut menu or in the Run entry Run As | Run on Server Select. To start in debug mode, invoke the menu item Debug As | Debug on Server instead of Run As | Run on Server. If you have not yet configured a server, Eclipse will open a setup wizard here. The book examples are Apache Tomcat 7.0 especially good - for detailed setup instructions, see the appendix in Section Section: Setting Up Apache Tomcat 7 in Eclipse.

When the server starts up, all log messages are displayed in a separate console window. After successful start Eclipse opens by default a browser window with the application. You can also call the web application in a browser of your choice as follows:

----
http://localhost:8080/helloworld/
----

Port 8080 and the helloworld context path refer to our Hello World example. You can open and edit the specific configuration of a server by double-clicking on the corresponding entry in the Servers tab.
 
Sometimes, despite correct code, unexplained errors can occur in the JSF application. In such cases, it is often helpful to restart the distribution process to solve problems with incomplete or non-redistributed files. To do this, select the affected server in the Servers tab and select Clean ... in the context menu.

If this measure does not help either, then in the second instance, only restarting Eclipse remains. A remedy can also be to delete and rebuild the server entry in the Servers tab. 

After this dig into the world of build tools and development environments, we'll cover the next section of the first version of our MyGourmet example. 

=== MyGourmet1: Introduction by example

In the course of the book, a small example application called MyGourmet will be gradually built up. The application is intended to be an online ordering service for epicurean delights of any kind. Understandably, the focus here is less on complete functionality or perfect design, but on communicating the basic concepts of JavaServer Faces. Each step adds MyGourmet to the aspects of JSF presented in each chapter. You can find the source code for all examples of this book at http://jsfatwork.irian.at.
 
The first step is to expand our Hello World for example, a simple form for entering a customer's data. There is a field for entering the first and last names and a submit button. After clicking the button, the data just entered is displayed again, in corresponding output fields with an additionally displayed success message.
 
First, we should finish the classes of our data model so that we can use them in the web application. This is simple - a simple Java class Customer with the two class variables firstName and lastName and its associated accessors getFirstName(), setFirstName(String firstName), getLastName() and setLastName(String lastName) are sufficient. The class is shown in Listing the Customer class.

.Customer.java
[source,java]
----
package at.irian.jsfatwork.gui.page;

import javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean;
import javax.faces.bean.SessionScoped;

@ManagedBean
@SessionScoped
public class Customer {
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;

  public String getFirstName() {
    return firstName;
  }
  public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }
  public String getLastName() {
    return lastName;
  }
  public void setLastName(String lastName) {
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}
----

*Managed-Bean:*
 
Access to the data model is done in JSF via so-called managed beans. In JSF it means JavaBeans, which are available under a unique name in the application. To register a managed bean of type Customer, it is sufficient to annotate the class with @ManagedBean as of JSF 2.0. The name under which the bean is available is derived from the class name and, in our case, is customer. 

The bean is assigned to a temporally restricted and user-related scope. With the also introduced in version 2.0 annotation @SessionScoped Let JSF re-create the managed bean once per HTTP session. 

Declaration of the View: Now we come to the most important part of our application: Somewhere this Managed Bean must be accessed, and we do it in a Facelets page. Facelets since JSF 2.0 are preferable to the standard and JavaServer Pages, more in Section Section: Page declaration languages: In MyGourmet 1 this is the page editCustomer.xhtml for entering the first and last name of the customer. The basic structure of the page is, as with the Hello World example, an HTML document with embedded JSF tags in the body-Element. 

In order for us to be able to process user input with our page, we need a form. JSF provides the tag h:form in the HTML tag library. The input fields for the first and last name of the customer are inserted into the page with the tag h:inputText within the form. So that users of the application can distinguish the input fields, they get a label via the tag h:outputLabel. The connection between the label and the input field is made by entering the ID of the input field in the for attribute of h:outputLabel. To align the individual elements in a table-shaped structure comes h:panelGrid used. 

The interesting thing about these tags is the value attribute of h:inputText. It includes a value expression that allows the value of a component to be linked to a property of a managed bean. This is done with the following syntax: After a hash As of JSF 1.2, a "$" character may also be used, as in the earlier defined JSP Expression Language: follows in curly brackets the name of the property in the form bean property. Generally this results in an expression in the form # {managedBean property} - as in Listing the file editCustomer.xhtml to see several times. 

We can already execute this application, we will get a page with the input fields defined by us. The next step is to redirect the user to the showCustomer.xhtml page, which in our case is a button. So we add a button to our XHTML page. The corresponding JSF tag is named h:commandButton. We provide this button with the action action, which is given the value /showCustomer.xhtml, and the value attribute with the Save label to be displayed in the browser. Clicking the button causes JSF to click the user in the attribute redirects action specified page. 

Prior to JSF 2.0, the navigation had to be defined in the configuration file faces-config.xml in the form of navigation rules. Starting with JSF 2.0, this step can be omitted by specifying the page directly. Further information on navigation can be found in Section: Navigation. 

The complete source code of the page editCustomer.xhtml can be found in Listing The file editCustomer.xhtml.

Before we can navigate to the showCustomer.xhtml page (listing the showCustomer.xhtml file), we must first create it. The new page should look similar to the first page, only replace now h:outputText tags for the h:inputText elements and an additional h:outputText tag gives the message "Customer saved successfully!" out.

.hello.xhtml
[source,xhtml]

*Execute application logic:* Done! The application works as desired and forwards us from the first page by clicking on the button - the second page displays the entered data. In a "real" application, we would now save the data by accessing a method of the underlying managed bean through the action triggered by the button. Again, this step is straightforward, instead of putting the action attribute directly on a string, we use a method expression that references a method in the underlying managed bean. Using the same syntax that we used previously on a variable in the managed-bean customer now we can also reference a method. The modified code of the button looks like this:

[source,html]
----
<h:commandButton id="save"
  action="#{customer.save}" value="Save"/>
----

*Action method:* The referenced method must not have a transfer parameter; it must return a string and declare it with public. For example, the method will perform database access and store the customer's data. We simply render that access as a comment. Finally, the method returns the string we previously included directly in the action property, which is /showCustomer.xhtml:

[source,java]
----
public String save() {
  return "/showCustomer.xhtml";
}
----

If the storage of the customer data has not been successful, another string should be returned. This triggers another navigation and, for example, displays the /editCustomer.xhtml page again. 

In the next chapter, we work together to develop the theoretical foundations for understanding JSF. After a brief look into JSF's tasks in the Section:Tasks of JSF Technology and the Definition of Some Basic Terms in the SectionJavaServer Faces in Tags, a second part of the example MyGourmet 1 follows in Section: MyGourmet 1: Keywords in Action, There, the understanding of the previously defined basic concepts in practice is deepened.
